# Ruby4Kids my_game

This [game](http://ruby4kids.com/ruby4kids/public/web_page/14) an arcade game of dodging the falling balls. It 
 is developed in three lessons by Ruby4Kids and each lesson has 2 or
 more 
 [videos](http://ruby4kids.com/ruby4kids/public/web_page/14).  At least one of these lessons has a problem where the code
 is not visible.  I have also renamed some of the variables and image files and because
 I am using Ruby 1.9.2 I have 
 replaced some `require` statements by 
 by `require_relative`.  The code for each video is _tagged_  in git so you can checkout code to that point.  If you are not familiar with git
 at least read
