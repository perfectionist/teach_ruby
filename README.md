# Teaching Ruby to my Grandson

This is a series of Ruby projects that I used to teach my grandson how to program.
The projects are games which holds more interest for young developers.
[*Ruby for Kids: Programming for the Fun of it*](http://ruby4kids.com/ruby4kids)
is used for the early projects.  

## Programming Environment ##

### Ruby and Gems ###
The Ruby4Kids site uses Ruby 1.8.7 and some workarounds if you use
version 1.9.2.  I chose to use version 1.9.2 and replace the
workarounds.  One example is `require_relative` versus adding the
current directory to the directories to search for a `require` statement. 

+ [*Ruby*](http://www.ruby-lang.org) version 1.9.2-p290
+ [*gosu*](http://rubygems.org/gems/gosu) version  0.7.33 universal-darwin

### Development Tools ###

On Mac there are a lot of development tools available.  I chose to go
simple on this project and use Aquamacs with YAS extension. iTerm 2 is
used when I don't want to use the Aquamacs built-in shell. Git is used
for version control.  I tag certain steps in the project to correspond
to key learning elements in the project. In the first Ruby4Kids
project the tags correspond to the code at the end of a video lesson.
RVM is Mac and *NIX only and just used to create a version bundle of
Ruby and gems for projects.  Since I am also working on Rails 3.0 and
3.1 projects it is handy to have a bundle just for this project
without the gems and code Rails has. GitHub is where I host all the code.

+ [*Aquamacs*](http://aquamacs.org/) version 2.3a 
+ [*iTerm 2*](http://www.iterm2.com/) version 1.0.0.20110727
+ [*git*](http://git-scm.com/) version 1.7.6
+ [*RVM*](https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/) version 1.6.31
+ [*GitHub*](https://github.com/)
